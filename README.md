Creating an HTML table
======================

This is probably not the coolest coding ever done, but it solves one boring aspect of working with tables as a journalist in Escenic.

The script loads a normal Excel table from a file named "tabell.xlsx" and converts it in R to a fully functioning HTML table, ready to be copied into Escenic's source code.

It requires a header. For the time being, all the columns are aligned left.
